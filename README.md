## Setting-Up-CTFd.md
This is a simple CTFd framework setup.

# CTFd-Instance/
The folder consists of:
## CTFd-Static-Instance.md 
This covers the static and beginner instances and how the containers work. One sample web-challenge will be given to set up for testing and learning.

## CTFd-Dynamic-Instance.md
Learn how to set up instances to host any challenges that require links, such as web, crypto, and rev. It will mention how to set up a TLS connection for the instances to work. Most importantly, this is the part where the "Start Instance" button is covered/created.
